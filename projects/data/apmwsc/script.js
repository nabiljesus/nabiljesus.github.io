<p><b>APMwSc</b>  (<i>A tool supporting the process of Agile Project Management with Scrum</i>) was the project we started to develop as part of our <b>"Software Engineering"</b> Course in the <i>Universidad Simón Bolívar</i>. </p>\
\
<p> Using <b>Flask</b> with <b>AngularJS, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL, Bootstrap, Selenium and Python</b> as tools, we were split in <i>six person teams</i> and had <i>five weeks</i> to develop this web application using Scrum as methodology (while learning about it).</p>\
\
<p> Our team, <i>"DSAD" or "Desarrolladores de Software de Alto Desempeño" (High Performance Software Developers)</i> sucefully managed to develop the solution, and between all the others teams (all of whom where working on another instance of the very same project)\
 we developed the best product, being honored as the "best development team 2015" and I beign honored with as "Most valuable team member". Likewise, our instance of APMwSc was selected as the instance to keep working on the course continuity.  </p>\
\
<p> Our team was conformed by: </p>\
<ul>\
<li> Cristina Betancourt </li>\
<li> Meggie Sánchez</li>\
<li> Javier López </li>\
<li> Nabil Márquez</li>\
<li> Roberto Rinaldi </li>\
<li> Samuel Rodriguez</li>\
